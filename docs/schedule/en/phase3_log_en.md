### Day 3

# 1. Improvements to Data Crawling (PubMed, Vinmec, Mayo)

### Current Progress

- Upgraded crawling algorithm with 20% accuracy improvement over previous version
- Handled common error cases when extracting data from complex HTML structures

### Pending Issues

- Some special cases still not properly handled
- Need to improve handling of JavaScript-loaded dynamic data

#### Next Steps

- Research alternative crawling methods using APIs where available
- Implement caching mechanism to reduce server requests
- Build error management system with auto-retry for failed items

# 2. Initial Data Standardization

#### Current Progress

- Built basic encoding process for collected data
- Started implementing text format and metadata standardization
- Developed unified data structure across different sources

#### Pending Issues

- Inconsistencies still appearing between data sources
- Need to improve medical vocabulary standardization process
- Duplicate information removal process incomplete

#### Next Steps

- Complete data processing and standardization tools
- Implement automated quality checks for standardized data
- Build temporary database for storing standardized data
